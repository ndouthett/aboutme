  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a 37 year old marine engineer that works in the oil and gas industry in Australia. For 6 months of the year you'll find me covered in grease or my head in some electrical or mechanical system - wondering if people who design vessels ever really go to sea or many other words that could only come from the mouth of a sailor. </p>
  <p>For the rest of the year I spend time with family and persue many diverse interests and hobbies.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>Why am I coding and other interests?</h2>
<p>Well, I can  blame the inventors of the Arduino protyping platform for sparking my interest in coding. I started learning alittle bit of C, then when the Raspberry Pi came out , I move on to Python and the many code cookbooks that are available.</p>
<p>Somehow I found my way to Ruby, Pragmatics Studio's ruby course ,rails 1 and 2. Which I must say was one of the best courses I've done online , mainly through the tireless support and feedback from Mike and of course Nicole Clark and well laid out material and resources.</p>
<p>Although I like ruby and the rails framework, I needed to learn HTML and CSS and I was intrigued about java script, as most of the websites I wanted to know how they worked had some element of java script in them</p>
<p>But above all, I wanted to make sure I was current and upto-date with what is happening in the tech world, build some apps , have fun and explore some business ideas along the way.</p>
<p>Apart from that I enjoy diving ,kite boarding and picking up heavy things and putting them down again and i am more than happy to sit down with a good book on marketing, psychology or personal development of some kind.</p>
